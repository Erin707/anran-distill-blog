Currently I am a Ph.D candidate in the Faculty of Educatoin and Social Work at The University of Auckland. I’ve only just decided to start blogging recently (Dec, 2020) as I was pulling my hair out rushing the finishing line of my thesis. Learning how to code and build my own website has strangely been quite a stress relief.\nI consider this place as a playground to experiment fun and new things. Serious stuff such as research, interesting stuff such as statistics, fun stuff such as coding (I know a bit of R but I’d like to develop my skills in Python and SQL), toy stuff such as LEGO, or even better, STAR WARS!\nThis site is still quite empty. I will put it aside for a while (hopefully) until I am done with the thesis.\n\n\n\n",
